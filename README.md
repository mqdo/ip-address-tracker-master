## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See their own IP address on the map on the initial page load
- Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location

## My process

### Built with

- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles
- [Geo Ipify](https://geo.ipify.org/) - API for IP Geolocation
- [React Leaflet](https://react-leaflet.js.org/) - API for Maps

### What I learned

In this challenge I learned how to use APIs to get information from IP addresses and learn an easy way to generate a map by using Leaflet's API. I also practice with React.js and Tailwind to add one more project to my portfolio.

### Continued development

After this challenge I will use more tools together to create flexible applications.

### Useful resources

- [React Leaflet Docs](https://react-leaflet.js.org/) - This helped me for knowing how React Leaflet works, as I have never worked with an API map like this before.
- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) - Of course, whenever I'm stuck with some bugs this is the place that can save me.
